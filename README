This is a proof-of-concept implementation of the Robot
Engineering Task Force's (RETF) Time-Indexed Data Entry (TIDE)
log container format.

Dependencies
------------

To build, you need at least CMake 2.6 -- see http://www.cmake.org/
Also, a C++ compiler is needed. This code has been tested with gcc 4.4

Building
--------

This project uses a regular CMake build, so you can just do 
"cmake . ; make". However I recommend building in a subdir. To
use that, do
	$ mdkir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make
